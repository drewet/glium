        <h2>Introduction</h2>

        <p>The Rust programming language aims to provide a safe environment, where you can't get
           any undefined behavior or crash. Glium is a Rust library that aims to push these goals
           for OpenGL as well.</p>

        <p>Its objectives:<ul>
         <li>Be 100 % safe to use.</li>
         <li>Avoid all OpenGL errors either with compile-time checks or runtime checks.
            If an OpenGL error is triggered, then it's a bug.</li>
         <li>Provide all the features that core OpenGL provides.</li>
         <li>Be compatible with the lowest OpenGL version possible, but still use 4.5 features
            if they are available.</li>
         <li>Be compatible with both OpenGL and OpenGL ES.</li>
        </ul></p>
      </div>
    </div>

        <h2>Examples</h2>

        <h3>Initialization</h3>

        <pre><code>use glium::DisplayBuild;
let display = glutin::WindowBuilder::new().build_glium().unwrap();</code></pre>

        <p>Glium is based on the Glutin library, which is a pure Rust alternative to
        traditional libraries like GLFW, SDL or GLUT. When you call <code>build_glium()</code>,
        Glium will build the window and query various informations about the backend.
        While Glutin is a partially unsafe library due to the unsafe nature of OpenGL contexts,
        Glium on the other hand is totally safe.</p>

        <p>The minimal requirements for Glium to start is an OpenGL 2.1 or an OpenGL ES 2 backend.
        If these are not met, <code>build_glium</code> returns an <code>Err</code>.</p>

        <h3>Loading an image into a texture</h3>

        <pre><code>let image_data = File::open(&amp;Path::new("image.png")).unwrap().read_to_end().unwrap();
let image = image::load(data, image::PNG).unwrap();
let texture = glium::texture::CompressedTexture2d::new(&amp;display, image);</code></pre>

        <p>Glium interacts well with the image library, allowing one to easily load
        images.</p>

        <p>You don't need to worry about client formats, data alignment, immutable storage,
        etc. Everything is handled automatically.</p>

        <h3>Render to texture</h3>

        <pre><code>use glium::texture::UncompressedFloatFormat::U8U8U8U8;

let mut texture = glium::Texture2d::new_empty(display, U8U8U8U8, 1024, 1024);

texture.as_surface().draw(&amp;vertex_buffer, &amp;index_buffer, &amp;program,
                          &amp;uniforms, &amp;params).unwrap();</code></pre>

        <p>Drawing on a texture is as easy as calling <code>texture.as_surface()</code>. Glium
        provides easy ways to execute the most common tasks.</p>

        <p>If you need some more elaborate features (like a depth or stencil buffer, or multiple
        render targets), Glium provides some structs in the <code>framebuffer</code> module.</p>

        <h3>Persistent mapping</h3>

        <pre><code>struct UniformBlockData {
  matrix: [[f32; 4]; 4],
  light: [f32; 3]
}

let mut buffer = glium::UniformBuffer::new_persistent(&amp;display, UniformBlockData {
  matrix: build_identity_matrix(),
  light: [12.4, -0.4, 3.8]
});

loop {
  buffer.map().light[0] += 0.1;   // `map()` returns the existing mapping

  texture.as_surface().draw(&amp;vertex_buffer, &amp;index_buffer, &amp;program,
                            uniforms! { MyBlock: &amp;buffer }, &amp;params).unwrap();
}</code></pre>

        <p>High-performance OpenGL applications need to reduce driver overhead by using
        techniques such as persistent mapping, indirect calls or bindless textures.</p>

        <p>Glium automatically uses sync fences to prevents the buffer from being accessed
        at the same time by the CPU and by the GPU.</p>

        <h2>Features</h2>

        <h3>Easy to use</h3>

        <p><ul>
        <li>Functions are higher level in Glium than in OpenGL. Glium's API tries to be as Rusty as
           possible, and shouldn't be much different than using any other Rust library.</li>

        <li>You can directly pass vectors, matrices and images to Glium instead of manipulating low-level
           data.</li>

        <li>Glium is designed to be very easy to setup.</li>

        <li>Glium should allow you to do everything that OpenGL allows you to do, just through high-level
           functions. If something is missing, please open an issue.</li>

        <li>Glium provides easier ways to do common tasks. For example the `VertexBuffer` struct
           contains information about the vertex bindings, because you usually don't use several different
           bindings with the same vertex buffer. Creating a program doesn't require creating shaders,
           attaching them, and linking - instead it is one single function call. Drawing on a texture
           is as easy as drawing on the backbuffer.</li>

        <li>Glium is stateless. There are no `set_something()` functions in the entire library, and
           everything is done by parameter passing. The same set of function calls will always produce
           the same results.</li>

        <li>Glium handles framebuffer objects, samplers, and vertex array objects for you. You no longer
           need to create them explicitely as they are automatically created when needed and destroyed
           when their corresponding object is destroyed.</li>
        </ul></p>

        <h3>Safety</h3>

        <p><ul>
        <li>Glium detects what would normally be errors or undefined behaviors in OpenGL, and panics,
           without calling `glGetError` which would be too slow. Examples include requesting a depth test
           when you don't have a depth buffer available, not binding any value to an attribute or uniform,
           or binding multiple textures with different dimensions to the same framebuffer.</li>

        <li>If the OpenGL context triggers an error, then you have found a bug in Glium. Please open
           an issue. Just like Rust does everything it can to avoid crashes, Glium does everything
           it can to avoid OpenGL errors.</li>

        <li>Glium uses RAII. Creating a `Texture2d` struct creates a texture, and destroying the struct
           destroys the texture. It also uses Rust's lifetime system to ensure that objects are still
           alive when you use them. Glium provides the same guarantees with OpenGL objects that you have
           with regular objects in Rust.</li>

        <li>High-level functions are much easier to use and thus less error-prone. For example there is
           no risk of making a mistake while specifying the names and offsets of your vertex attributes,
           since Glium automatically generates this data for you.</li>

        <li>You can access the same Glium context from multiple threads simultaneously without
           having to worry about thread-safety.</li>
        </ul></p>

        <h3>Compatibility</h3>

        <p><ul>
        <li>In its default mode, Glium should be compatible with both OpenGL and OpenGL ES. If something
           doesn't work on OpenGL ES, please open an issue.</li>

        <li>During initialization, Glium detects whether the context provides all the required
           functionality, and returns an `Err` if the device is too old. Glium tries to be as tolerant
           as possible, and should work with the majority of the OpenGL2-era devices.</li>

        <li>Glium will attempt to use the latest, optimized versions of OpenGL functions. This includes
           buffer and texture immutable storage and direct state access. It will automatically fall back
           to older functions if they are not available.</li>

        <li>Glium comes with a set of tests that you can run with `cargo test`. If your project/game
           doesn't work on specific hardware, you can try running Glium's tests on it to see what is wrong.</li>
        </ul></p>

        <h3>Performances</h3>

        <p><ul>
        <li>State changes are optimized. The OpenGL state is only modified if the state actually differs.
           For example if you call `draw` with the `IfLess` depth test twice in a row, then
           `glDepthFunc(GL_LESS)` and `glEnable(GL_DEPTH_TEST)` will only be called the first time. If
           you then call `draw` with `IfGreater`, then only `glDepthFunc(GL_GREATER)` will be called.</li>

        <li>Just like Rust is theoretically slower than C because of additional safety checks, Glium is
           theoretically slower than well-prepared and optimized raw OpenGL calls. However in practice
           the difference is very low, if not negligible.</li>
        </ul></p>
